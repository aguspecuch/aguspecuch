## 👩 About me:
I'm 23 years old and I live in Buenos Aires, ARG. I've always been interested in technology but because of life events it wasn't until 2020 that I could actually start learning how to code (thanks global pandemic!). I'm currently learning Java at Ada ITW BackEnd Bootcamp and JavaScript at a CoderHouse course. I love to self-taught myself too. I hope that soon I can find my first job so I can learn even more things 💻

Apart from technology, I really love dogs 🐶. I actually form part of "Amigo a Casa" a ONG that rescues dogs from the streets and try to find them a new home for life 💖
